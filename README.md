## Amazon Price Tracker

A system that implements an Amazon price checker using Python modules such as Beautiful Soup and Pandas and sends the results by email would typically have several components.


First, the system would need to use web scraping techniques to extract the pricing data from Amazon. The pricing data would then be analyzed using Pandas to identify any significant changes or opportunities for cost savings.


When the price checker system is triggered, perhaps on a scheduled basis or triggered by a user's request, the system would then generate an email containing the pricing data analysis results. This email could include information such as the current price of the product, the price change over time, and any recommendations for purchasing the product at a lower price.


To send the email, the system could use Python's built-in smtplib module, which provides a way to send emails using the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP).
